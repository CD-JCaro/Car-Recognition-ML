  <p>Using the dataset [Cars196 Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html) we </p>
  <p>cleaned up the dataset to the best of our ability to train our machine on the 8,000 plus images</p>
  <p>found in our dataset. We then tested the other 8,000 plus images to make sure our machine was in</p>
  <p>working order. A picture of a car was then uploaded to see if the machine could predict the </p>
  <p>Make, Model and Year of the car. This was then hosted on a website.</p>
